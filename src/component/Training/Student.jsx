        We offer educative workshops for children, parents and teachers.
        Children’s workshops target different dimensions of the child’s
        personality. Which are essential for global development. Some of these
        include persona build-up, gender education, stress free living, study
        skills and spiritual growth. They build upon the children’s strengths by
        enabling them to open up to others easily and express their views, help
        them set positive impressions on their peers, allow sharing of ideas,
        and add to their own confidence. Sessions for parents enhance parenting
        skills while those for teachers target optimal teacher-student
        relationships and ways for teachers to deal with children better.
